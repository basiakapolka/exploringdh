I added 2 interactive buttons to my site. One is to toggle the theme from light to dark. It appears in the navigation bar, and should change the background from white to black and the text from black to white when you click it. The second is a "Fancy Font" button which changes the font from sans-serif to serif when you click on it. This also appears in the navigation bar.
